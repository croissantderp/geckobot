Geckobot is a open-source discord bot which can do some mysterious things. 

Some notable examples include:
* World domination (in-progress)
* Quantum computing (using [q#](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum))
* DecTalk synthesis (idea borrowed from [here](https://github.com/freddyGiant/study-bot))
* Only caused two mass extinction events!
* Integration of the [geckocollection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Omwv0NNV0k_xlECZq3d4r0MbSbuHC_Og?usp=sharing)
* Emote and text storage
* Absolutely (not) fair games!
* VC features (which always work except when they don't)
